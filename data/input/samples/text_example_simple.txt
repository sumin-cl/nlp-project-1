Curious, how did the others imagine what Tolkiens fantasy races were during childhood? 

I had the image, that the world was largely empty and that there was the bastion of humanity against the dark.

That the Elves of Middle Earth were the last remnant of theirs, with most having been corrupted by Sauron into Orcs over the course of multiple ages. They gathered their last strength at the Last Alliance and fought Sauron one last time, despite their inevitable destiny of disappearing.

I imagined Elves, that they could be corrupted in a way that isn't possible for humans, as they do not die of old age nor have the resilience to indefinetly withstand torture. So they were reluctant to fight Sauron, as this fate awaited them if they were captured.

Millenia of torture then made them what they are later on, hence why there's so many of them. They were the tortured from all the times past, or bred from them.

Whereas a human just dies. 

Humans are the steadfast bulwark against Sauron, whereas the few Elves decide to leave, while having a oversized importance overall. They have short lives, so all they can do is make the most out of it. Feel what's there to feel, fight Sauron as there is no other choice for them.

I thought of Elves being about the story of loss. If you're immortal, you'll see those close to you die and vanish. But also of kind of a indifference and sad hypocrisy.

As the reader, i could always identify with the humans. Sometimes also with the Hobbits, even with Dwarves. Elves were alongside Orcs the least of it.
