The machine was standing on a sloping lawn of a garden. This garden was cut out of the rhododendron bushes, and the purple flowers were dropping under the beating of the hailstones. The dancing hail, the thunderstorms, and the shifting grey sky were ending. The sun came out, a pale yellow sun, but its light was very welcome. I looked about me. A little way off, there was a rich green lawn, and then the dark shadow of a thick forest. I saw no people. The air was free from that cold, damp smell, and it was full of the scent of flowers. I felt that I was in a safe place, yet I could not shake off the feeling of fear. Time travelling is a dangerous business.
